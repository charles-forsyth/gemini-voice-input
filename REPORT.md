# 🚀 Gemini Voice Input - Project Report

## 🌌 Project Vision & State
The `gemini-voice-input` repository has been fully initialized, upgraded, and securely pushed to GitHub. This tool represents a major upgrade in workflow efficiency, providing deep Linux integration for Google's state-of-the-art **Chirp 3** model for high-fidelity speech-to-text. 

## 🛡️ Recent Triumphs (Mission 1771556204)
The latest push resolves a critical issue where the agent would fail to transcribe audio due to `global` region limitations for the `chirp` model, resulting in an empty clipboard.

### 🔧 Architecture Fixes
- **Model Endpoints:** Re-routed the `SpeechClient` explicitly to `us-central1-speech.googleapis.com`. Google's V2 `chirp` model requires a regional deployment and is no longer supported globally.
- **Fail-Fast Error Handling:** The Python core now strictly raises a `SystemExit(1)` error if the API fails, preventing false-positive success codes.
- **Resilient Clipboard Engine:** If Wayland (`wl-copy`) is installed but fails to execute (e.g., you are currently in an X11 session), the script now dynamically falls back to `xclip` instead of hard-crashing. 
- **User Interface (UI):** The trigger script (`voice_trigger.sh`) now properly interprets exit codes to alert the user with a `notify-send` error pop-up rather than a false "Transcription Ready" success message.

## 👨‍💻 The Skywalker Development Workflow
This project adheres to the strictest coding standards:
1. **Toolchain:** `uv` handles all dependency management and virtual environments with extreme speed.
2. **Quality Gates:** 
    - `ruff` (Linting & Formatting)
    - `mypy` (Static Type Checking)
    - `pytest` (Unit Testing)
3. **CI/CD Readiness:** The project structure has been fortified to support automated GitHub Action checks on future PRs.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (The Awesome Additions)
- [ ] **Multi-Language Support:** Allow real-time translation flags.
- [ ] **Offline Fallback:** Integrate local Whisper models (`whisper.cpp`) if the internet connection drops.
- [ ] **Configuration File:** Add a `~/.config/gemini-voice/config.toml` file to allow users to override settings like `SILENCE_LIMIT`, `THRESHOLD`, and `MODEL_REGION` without modifying code.
- [ ] **Daemon Mode:** Convert the script into a long-running background daemon for even faster trigger-to-record latency.
